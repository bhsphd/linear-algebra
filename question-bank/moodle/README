linear-algebra/question-bank

These are questions for the Free learning system Moodle.  You must use
MathJax; see the Moodle web site for that.

They are keyed to the slides and are intended to be used in class, so they
are often elementary -- what is the 2,3 entry of the matrix-type questions.

I have not class-tested these.  I would be interested in feedback.

(Note that the .sage files are a check that the answers are correct.)
