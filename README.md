_Linear Algebra_ is a Free text for an undergraduate mathematics course. It covers the standard topics: Gauss's method, vector spaces, linear maps, determinants, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The PDF of the _Linear Algebra_, and of the answer book, the beamer slides, and the lab manual, are at the book's home page [joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra](http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra). You can also buy hard copies for less than the cost of copying and binding. These are available from Amazon for single-person copies or from the college bookstore source if you are an instructor; see the web page for more information and links. 

# Summary

What sets this book apart is its developmental approach. It does not assume students are mathematically sophisticated, so it includes lots of examples, lots of motivation, and clear exposition. But it also assumes that the goal is to make the students more sophisticated, so everything is proved, it works to nudge readers by pointing out the advantages of a more advanced viewpoint, and in particular, it does vector spaces and linear maps as early as practical.

In addition to the main text, every chapter ends with a few Topics that illustrate applications or extensions of the material in that chapter. These are suitable for independent reading, for group work, or for a one-day presentation as a break.

There are many exercise in each section. The answer book contains a completely-worked solution for every exercise, including the proofs.    
It is set up so that if you click on the question then you are taken to the answer and if you click on the answer you come back to the question.

Besides the answer book, there are beamer slides for classroom use. These are keyed to the text, including that they use the same wording and numbering for theorems, definitions, etc.

And, there is a lab manual for computer work, using *Sage*. It introduces students to doing linear algebra on a computer, and also does a number of important applications that are difficult by hand but easy on a machine.
