Notes on getting the lab to compile.

1) The script runlab.sh should compile the lab.  It sets up TEXINPUTS,
calls xelatex, then runs the PythonTeX script, then runs the Sage python
script, then runs xelatex again.

2) The main problem is getting the console information from Sage.  Fortunately,
a recent update to sagetex.sty has provided the means.  But it may take some
installation.

Get a sagetex.sty with a version of 3.2 (dated Jan 9, 2019) or later.
Put it in your local TeX tree and compile it.  I did this under Ubuntu Linux.

    cd /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/
    sudo mv /home/ftpmaint/Downloads/sagetex.zip .
    --remove any old directory sagetex/--
    sudo unzip sagetex
    cd sagetex
    sudo pdflatex sagetex.ins
    sudo pdflatex sagetex.dtx
    sudo texhash

Now, the tricky part.  When you run "sudo pdflatex sagetex.ins" you get told
to move the .sty to where LaTeX will find it, which is taken care of by the
later "texhash" command.  But you also get told to move sagetex.py to
where it can be found.  Turns out that is in the sage dir tree.  Fixing it
took this.

    sudo cp sagetex.py /usr/lib/sagemath/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sagetex.py
